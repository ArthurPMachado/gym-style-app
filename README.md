# Gym style app

## A Node app to bind users to gyms and validate their check-ins

The idea behind the project is to connect users to close gyms in their proximity,
with a similar approach to what apps like GymPass does, which get closer gyms and 
register their check-in.

It's also a part of my personal portfolio, which I use to explore E2E tests, SOLID principles
and some of other design patterns, like: Repository, Factory and In Memory Database
